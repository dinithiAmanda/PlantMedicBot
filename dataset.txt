basic requirement of Tea grows best in warm and humid climates It will tolerate temperatures between 14 and 27°C (57.2–80.6°F) with 18–20°C (64.4–68°F) being optimum 
Tea plants will not tolerate frost and mean temperatures should not fall below 13°C (55.4°F) or exceed 29°C (84.2°F) Tea grows optimally in deep, well-draining, tropical red soils with an acidic pH between 4.5 and 6.0. 
Tea requires an average annual rainfall of 1600 mm per year distributed evenly throughout the growing season In growing regions that experience a long dry season, tea plants require shading to increase the humidity around the plants. 

propogation Tea is propagated from seed or rooted leaf cuttings Good quality seeds are selected by immersing in water for 30 minutes and selecting the seeds which sink
Seeds are commonly germinated by placing them between wet cloths Seeds which successfully germinate are transferred to a nursery bed to grow for 2–3 years 
Before transplanting to the field, the plants are cut back to a height of 15 cm (6.0 in) Leaf cuttings are also used to establish new tea plantations
Single node cuttings are taken from the desired variety and rooted in polyethylene bags containing soil by firmly pressing the stem into the soil
The bags are then placed in a shaded area and watered regularly New tea plants produced from rooted cuttings are usually planted out in the field after 6–9 months
Tea can be planted as single rows, double rows or as a hedge Plantations established on slopes are planted on contour rows
Seedlings or cuttings are usually planted 60 cm (24 in) apart, allowing 1.5 m (5 ft) between rows The tea plants are often interplanted with legumes or grasses to conserve soil moisture and prevent soil erosion
Shade trees are utilized in tea plantations grown at lower altitudes. 

General care and maintenance of tea,Newly planted tea plantations must be kept free from weeds while the tea plants establish Weeding should be done by hand until the canopy closes and shades out weeds 
Tea plants should be pruned to encourage the production of lateral branches Busjes are shaped by tipping and thinning of branches to create the desired shape 
Pruning should be maintained throughout the life of the plantation to keep the plants a manageable size and maintain productivity
pruning is best carried out when the plants are dormant where possible If trees do not have a dormant period then they should be pruned in winter or after the dry period depending on geographic location
The tree clippings can be left in the centers of the rows to acts as an organic mulch Tea plantations are usually fertilized 2–3 times per year
The amount of each nutrient added to the soil will depend on the soil’s own deficiencies and should ideally be based on the results of soil testing or by testing the leaves for nutrient deficiencies.

Harvesting Tea is harvested by “plucking” which involves the removal of the youngest leaves at the shoot terminals The terminal bud is removed along with the two leaves directly below (fine plucking) or the bud and three leaves (coarse plucking)
The younger leaves have the best flavor and removing three leaves increases production but diminishes the overall quality by including an older leaf Tea plants are plucked by hand by graspi.


Leaf infection
Until the advent of blister blight in 1946, there was no leaf disease of my economic importance in Sri Lanka This was considered 
surprising in view of the humid conditions associated with tea culture, the large volume of leaf of all ages produced by the tea 
plant and the dense cover of foliage that is maintained most of the time

There are several other leaf diseases caused by weak and occasional parasites, the attacks of wich are normally associated either 
with prior damage to the leaf surface and exceptional weather conditions or as a consequence to a general debility of the tea bush.

Blister Blight(Exobasidium vexans)
Blister blight leaf disease of tea is caused by the fungus Exobasidium vexans Massee Most importantly the fungus causing blister blight 
an infect only young succulent leaves, stems and the pericarp of the fruit when tender (Plates 14.1 to 14.3) As the tea bush is cultivvated 
for its tender shoots, and for thet reason alone, blister blight leaf disease is of major economic importance and its control costs 
the country several millions of rupees per annum

The fungus causing the disease is an obligate parasite, incapable of getting its nourishment from dead matter, and so far as is known, 
is able to get it only from the live flush of the tea bish There are on alternative hosts known for this pathogen

As the tissues (leaf, stem, pericarp) become mature, they develop resistance to infection
if not for this characteristic, the survival of tea as an economic crop in many parts of Sri
Lanka would have met with the same fate that befell the coffee industry in 1869 Coffee
rust caused by the fungus, Hemelia vastatrix devastated 160,000 ha of plantations in the
ensuing 20 years.

Laef manifestation
The first visible symptom is a pale yellow or lime green spot, which is more translucent
than the rest of the leaf spot may sometimes be pink, red or brown dcpendmg on the
reaction of different tea cultivars to the infection The spot gradually enlarges in the form
of a cirele of increasing diameter, reaching a maximum size Of just over 12.5 mm The
rate of enlargement of the blister depends on environmental conditions as well as on
internal physiological characteristics of the leaf As the disease progresses inside the
leaf, the upper surface of the developing blister becomes indented, corresponding with a
protrusion of the lower surface, which becomes white and powdery as spore production
begins Though not very common, sometimes these protrusions can curve upward with the
corresponding indentation on the lower surface But still, the spore production takes
place on the lower surface of the leaf After sporulation the blister begins to dry up,
starting at the centre, and the blistered area becomes brown as the leaf tissues die This
area is soon invaded by various saprophytic fungi, the most common secondary invader
being the brown blight causing Colletrotnchum camelhae A leaf may have one or more
centres of infections When several blisters develop on a single leaf, it becomes curled
and distorted.

Stem indication
When the fungus infects young stems the infections grow and mature along the longitudinal
axis of stems, assuming a slender oval shape, later turning into velvety white patches, as
opposed to the eircular blisters of the leaves The infected stem first bends in the opposite
direction due to expansion of tissues at the point of infection The infected patches are
usually thicker than healthy areas This leads to distorted stems thereby resulting in serious
set backs to growth Very often they break off or result in dieback of shoots beyond this
point Repeated stem infections can weaken the plants considerably and, if allowed to
continue without being arrested through proper control measures, the bushes can
eventually die.

biological science 
The disease is spread by windborne basidiospores Under favourable conditions, a spore
coming into contact with the upper surface of a young leaf or stem, germinates within
6-10 hours and forms an 'appressorium' (or infecting structure) During this period the
fungus is very sensitive to desiccation as well as the fungicidal effect of sunshine and
chemicals In 10-14 hours after the formation of the appressorium, the fungus penetrates
the leaf surface, and is then protected from external agencies like sunshine and contact
fungicidal spray deposits on the leaf surface The fungus now begins to utilise the leaf
tissue for its growth Eight to 10 days aner penetration, the first visible sign of infection
appears as a translucent spot, which is a result of the disruption of the leaf tissue Fifteen
to 17 days after penetration (7-9 days after the appearance of the translucent spot), the
fungus either ruptures the lower epidermis of the leaf or emerges through the stomata
and begins to produce bzusidiospores A mature sporulating blister, therefore, is produced
18-21 days after penetration Each of these mature blisters is capable of liberating an
enormous number of spores into the atmosphere A blister may sporulate for 7-8 days
before it begins to die This is indicated by the browning of the blister, starting from its
centre.

Distribution and Tirne of occurrence of the aliment
In the western sector of the growing regions, all estates above 600 m (2000 ft) receiving
the South-West (SW) monsoon rains in May-July and the North-East (NE) rains in
Swptember-December are subject to this disease during those periods In the eastern sector
(Uva region), blister blight becomes a problem only during the NE monsoon (September-December)
This disease can become more prevalent and severe with increasing elevation
However, this can be encountered at elevations less than 600 m where high humidity and
heavy shade levels persist, but this very rarely causes economic losses.

Conditions Favouring the Disease blister blight
Moisture is the most critical factor in causing infections by this fungus A very high
relativehumidity (85 per cent) is required for the production, release as well as germination
of spores Mist, cloud and rain, the incidence of blister blight, while desiccation
and exposure to direct sunlight, kill both fresh and germinating spores.

Blister Blight and Shade
As sunshine is detrimental to the growth of this fungus, it is to assume that
the removal ofshade trees will help in the control of the disease Conversely, the weather
most favourable to its growth is characterised by the absence of sunshine and, at such
times, the intensity of the disease may not be very much influenced by the presence or
absence of shade However, dense shade should always be avoided particularly in mist
pockets This should never justify complete removal of shade even in mist pockets, in
view of the very good reasons they were introduced to the tea plantations It would be
desirable to reduce shade as appropriate by thinning/lopping of established shade with
the onset of monsoon.

be in Control of Blister Blight
The most efficient protection against any disease is the strong natural resistance inherent
or developed by the plant No cultivars have so far been shown to be totally resistant to
blister blight Only gradations in susceptibility have been found among different cultivars
of tea Fortunately, copper fungicides have been found to give adequate protection against
blister blight in tea Copper fungicides are protective in action When sprayed, the copper
deposited on the leafsurface prevents the germination of blister spores, thereby preventing
any fresh infection By the same token, no copper fungicide will have any effect, if it is
applied after the fungus has penetrated the leaf Once the fungus is inside the leaf, copper
on its surface will not prevent the fungus from forming a blister.

advocation for Spraying of Fungicides
i) Copperfungicides (wettablepowders)containing 50 percent (w/w) metallic copper
in the oxide, oxychloride or hydroxide form are recommended for the control of
blister blight

In whatever form, copper fungicides remain to be the cheapest and most effective
Since they are only protective in action, regular spraying of Cu is essential for
effective control If any copper fungicide contains a different strength of metallic
copper (ie 25 per cent or 35 per cent) appropriate rates of applications should be
worked out on a proportionate basis

ii) systemic firngieides (Ergosterol Biosynthesis Inhibitors) of organic origin are also
recommended

These have been found to have protectant as well as curative properties but they
are always more costly Once sprayed, they remain active for a relatively longer
period This factor has made the use of systemic fungicides to be favoured over
copper fungicides, particularly when labour is scarce and wages are becoming
increasingly prohibitive.

(a) Nurseries - Spray copper fungicides every four days @ 90-120 g or systemic
fungicides every 10 days 25 ml in 45 L of water for approximately 30,000 plants
2 area) using a knapsack sprayer.

(b) Tea Recovering From Pruning - spray copper fungicides once every 4 or 5 days@
370-490 g or systemic fungicides once every 10 days @ 85 ml in 170 L of water per
hectare, using knapsack sprayers or in 30-45 L per hectare, using mist-blowers, up to the
of tipping However, it is preferable to use knapsack sprayers The most critical
time for a tea bush, as far as blister blight is concerned, is when it is recovering from
which normally coincides with the monsoons During this time all the leaves are
voung and a few or none are mature Loss of any young leaves or stems is vital at this
stage and they can be replaced only at further expense of food reserves Therefore, if the
bush is not protected against blister blight, at this stage, repeated withdrawal of food
reserves for shoot growth could exhaust the tea bush sometimes even up to the point of
death.

(c) Tea in Plucking - Spray copper fungicides once every 7-10 days @ 220-420 g or
systemic fungicides once every 10-14 days @ 85 ml, depending on the plucking round,
in 170 L of water per hectare, using knapsack sprayers or in 30-45 L per hectare using
mist-blowers Spraying should be done on the day following plucking, always maintaining
a minimum Pre Harvest Interval (PHI) of seven days in order to remain within Maximum
Residue Limits (MRL) set by tea importing/consuming countries.

Spraying Against Blister Blight in Relation to Weather Condition
The fungicidal properties of sunshine alone can be exploited to control blister blight
effectively Four hours of sunshine a day is adequate to prevent growth and the subsequent
infection by the spore deposits, of the previous day This can be exploited successfully to
maintain blister blight infections at economie threshold levels Twenty hours ofeumulative
sunshine over the preceding five days could help postponing of a spraying round against
blister blight in its control programme This method of monitoring the sunshine hours
and relating it to spraying schedules, can be used to effect savings up to 25 per cent on
spraying of the fungicides and therefore in the cost of control The benefits accruing
from such a system could be particularly more at the beginning as well at the end of the
monsoons.


Brown blight leaf disease of tea was first recorded in Sri Lanka in 1899 (Gadd, 1948)
There had been a few reports of considerable damage caused by brown blight in the past,
Particularly in bushes recovering from pruning Wet weather normally favours brown
blight diseiuse The causal organism, Colletrotrichum camelliae Massee, is a weak parasite
and readily enters injured cells causing rapid death of tissues and thereafter lives on dead
material The disease is more common on older and mature leaves

C) camelliae easily invades areas affected by blister blight at all stages of disease
development premature browning followed by blackening of blisters is caused by C
camelliae a result of secondary invasion. This secondary infection by brown blight
could sometimes influcnee more rapid and extensivel damage on the leaf lamina of certain
cultivars than when the infection is due to blister blight alone.

brown blight advocate
The patches usually start at the margin of the leaves and spread inwards the edges of the 
patches are sharply defined the colour of the upper surface is yellowish to chocolate
brown at first, gradually changing to grey-black from the center outwards these patches
are more often marked with characteristically delicate conentric zonations Minute, black,
scattered dots the fructifitions, appear on both sides of the diseased patch.

dominance
Since the disease is of occasional importance, no special control measures are
recommended The fungicides that are used in the control of blister blight, particularly
the copper fungicides, provide adequate control in the event of any disease outbreaks.

GREY BLIGHT (Pestalotia theae)
The fungus, Pestalotia theae Sawada, which causes grey blight, behaves in the same
way as C camelliae, which causes brown blight Both affect old, injured or sun-scorched
leaves and normally gain entry through a wound or into tissues that are weakened by
some means It is not a major problem under Sri Lankan conditions, but causes heavy
damage to tea in Japan.

evidence for grey blight
Diseased patches are light to dark brown with a greyish centre on the upper surface
Roughly circular to oval shaped patches are marked with eoneentrie zonations On mature
patches, black pustules (fruiting bodies) can be seen aligned with the eoneentrie lines on
the upper leaf surface.

Cercosporella LEAF DISEASE (Calonectria theae Loos)
This minor leaf disease of tea was first observed by Peteh in 1909 who, at that time,
described the causal fungus as Cercospowlla theae Peteh and the disease is commonly
identified by that name yet The fungus also attacks Acacia decurrens and Dadaps that
are grown as shade trees in tea The former is considered to be the main source of infection
of tea foliage, through its infected leaves that fall on the tea bushes that grow underneath.

testimony for Cercosporella
The attack starts off as a number of small spots about a millimeter wide Spots are grey
with a blackish margin Occasionally, the spread of the fungus is much more
diffused and spots may cover a large part of the leaf This second form is more severe
and can be associated with defoliation.

manage Cercosporella
Special control measures are not recommended for leaf diseases of minor economie
Importance such as Brown Blight, Gray Blight and Cereosporella Leaf Disease With
regular sprayings being done for blister blight, these three diseases do not pose problems
any more Occasional outbreaks in heavy mist pockets can be brought under eontrol with
the usual copper fungicidal sprays.

Black Blight (Rhizoctonia solani)
Black blight disease was first reported from Kalutara district by Gadd in 1929 The disease
is caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn the fungus is soil borne and attacks
plants in the nursery when they are heavily shaded It also infacts young plants in new
clearing under exceptionally high and continuous rainfall conditions, unsually in the 
moths of may to july and october to december climatic conditions conducive to attack
are considered to be at least 500 mm of rainfall and less than 150 sunshine hours per
(Mulder et al, 1962) The is confined to warmer humid parts of the Low
country districts.

clu for Black Blight
The disese appears as irregular black spots on the leaves, especially on those near the
soil Infection starts from the soil, with the fungus mycelium growing up on
the stem till it reaches the base of the leaf and progresses along the midrib until a greater
part of the leaf becomes necrotic The leaf then dies completely, and becomes detached
from the stem Many dead leaves often remain suspended by means of the cobweb-like
mycelium of the fungus that spreads along the stem Continuous rainfall conditions may
result in stem infections, which could lead to die back or death of young VP plants.

supervice for Black Blight
Shade should be thinned out in heavily shaded nurseries during exceptionally high and
continuous rainfall With the first appearance of widespread leaf spotting, a drenching
spray with a 50 per cent (w/w) copper fungicide at a dilution of 25 g in 10 L of water
using a knapsack sprayer should be given If the rain continues, the treatment should be
repeated after a fortnight

In new clearings, spraying must be done when stem infection is noticed The above
dilution of copper spray is adequate, but to achieve a drenching spray of the plants and
the soil immediately underneath, approximately 450 L of water would be required for a
hectare.

STEM DISEASES
The woody stem Of the plant is protected by living cells of the bark, which offer
considerable resistance to invasion by microorganisms mainly the fungi, living in their
environments but the process of regular prining undertaken at 3to 5 year intervals in
tea cultivation, exposes the woody tissues, which are easily accessed by both parasitic as
well as saprophytic fungi, following pruning In a well-developed branch, the part which
is alive and active is the outer layer, whereas the central part of the branch is composed
of defunct tissues which do not perform any physiological function This serves as a
ready source of food for all wood rotting fungi At the same time, there are some parasitic
fungi, which can invade live tissues, and are capable of producing cankers These cankers
the inner wood tissues, which become prone to secondary invasion by wood
expose fungi Wood rot caused by the former process is more common and is extensive
than the latter.

GESERAL WOOD ROT (Schizophyllum commune)
wood rot is by far the most serious stem condition that is present in tea in Sri Lanka
today Almost all the seedling teas are associated with a considerable amount of wood rot
and the annual death toll among them due to wood rot is significant A good per cent of
the older tea cultivars too are found to be afllicted with some wood rot in proportion to

The natural process of healing ofa wound is through the formation of callus tissues and
this process is slow in tea, especially in the large pruning cuts As a result when a branch
is pruned, the portion of the stem between the cut and the first new bud to develop below
it, dies naturally These snags are normally invaded by saprophytic fungi They travel
down the heart-wood of the live branches and rot it internally Scavenging termites may

become active in the rotted tissue and are very often mistaken for the cause of the problem
saprophytic fungi can also enter the stem through dead patches caused by sun scorch of
the exposed surface particularly on horizontal branches.

direct for GESERAL WOOD ROT
Since pruning is an indispensable agronomic operation in tea cultivation, preventive
measures afford a lot of potential in its management Leaving of prunings on bush frames,
up to 72 hours affords a reasonable protection from the inevitable sun scorching of lateral
branches Painting of pruning cuts with a fungicidal wound dressing can provide good
protection If snags above the newly emerged shoots are removed, there is a possibility
that callus growth formed in the surrounding live wood will cover the exposed eut surface
thus preventing any further infection Partly rotted branches should be removed as far
back as possible during the subsequent pruning cycle and the cut surfaces painted over
with a wound dressing Ifthe bushes are already badly affected, these measures will only
help to prolong their economie lifespan It is more economical to replace the very badly
affected bushes in the long run, rather than trying to resurrect them.

THORNY STEM BLIGHT (Tunstallia aculeata)
Thorny stem blight is caused by the fungus Tunstallia aculeata (Petch) Agnihothrudu
This was formerly known as Aglaospora aculeata Petch Thorny Stem blight results in
decay of tea stem wood, the fungus having gained access through wounds caused by
pruning and sun scorch It is therefore considered to be a weak parasitic situation with a
minor disease status (Peteh, 1906) Because of its parasitie nature, it can travel down the
branch, killing live tissues causing decay of stem wood If allowed to spread unchecked,
it could reach the main stem of the bush causing death of the invaded branch or the entire

bush Heavilty infected bushes start collapsing in stages, branch by branch until it
the loss of the entire bush.

administer for Thorny stem blight
Distribution of Thorny stem blight is limited to the Up country districts exceeding 1500
m (4500 ft) in elevation Certain cultivars of narrow jat tea such as TRI 2142, N2 and
K145 have been observed to be more afflicted by the disease compared to others.


omen for THORNY STEM BLIGHT
The fungus does not produce any external mycelium, but it produces designs and lines in
faded black colour, following the progressive pattern ofthc infection through stem wood
Small white star-shaped strands of mycelium (similar to that produced by Rosellinia
arcuata) can be seen on the surface of the wood when the bark is peeled off If the
infaction has reached the root zone, upon removing of the bark, black fern-leaf-like fans
of mycelium can be observed Discoloured zones could be expected as in the stem The
cdisease annot be distinguished from ordinary wood rot until the advanced stages of
infaction, by which time the branch or the bush may be dead. Thereafter, it produces the
characteristic fruiting structures, which penetrate the bark These fructifications are easily
recognised as black thorny projections on the bark of the affected stem
They are easier to feel with the fingers than be able to see Fructifications can also be
present on the bark of the roots The spread of the disease is by airborne spores.

oversee for thorny stem blight
Avoid planting very susceptible cultivars in disease prone areas If on account of its
other favourable characters, a known susceptible cultivar is preferred, it would be best to
take necessary preventive measures This could be achieved by protecting the possible
entry points, which are the pruning cuts, using an appropriate protective fungicidal paint
For the success ofthis operation, it should be started with the first pruning and be continued
every subequent pruning

Once the infection has established, no system of pruning-out branches is of any use in its
control The whole bush should be uprooted and burnt to avoid the risk of dispersing the
inoculum in the environment, which will result in subsequent infections.

Hypoxylon Stem Blight(Nemania diffusa)
Hypoxylon stem blight, has emerged a disease in Sri Lanka relatively recently
(Arulpragasam and Baixsuriya 1991) The disease is caused by Nemania, diffusa
(sowerby) Y M Ju and J D Rogers, (Syn Hypoxylon vestitum) (Ju, 1997) Petch in
1924 described H the first in sn Lanka having obtained it from a tea
branch from Diyanillakelle Estate in Lindula

The causal organism is considered to be a wound parasite The fungus gains entry through
wounds, mainly of the pruning cuts Onece infected, the operation of pruning itself would
induce furtherinfecions through pruning knives The parasitic nature of the fungus allows
it to kill live tissues causing extensive decay of stem wood once the infection is
established the bushes start collapsing in stages like in the casc of Illorny stem blight,
resulting in similar premature death or affected bushes.

Diffution for Hypoxylon Stem Bligh
In its spread and distribution, it follows a similar trend as in Thorny stem blight The
disease shows more amnity towards a similar group or cultivars of the low jat type such
as K145, PK2, N2, DTI, UR9, SJ76, etc, grown at higher elevations (>1500 m).

angury for Diffution for Hypoxylon stem bligh
The first visible symptoms are the yellowing, wilting and scorching Of foliage of an
entire branch, all following each other in quick succession When the disease is in an
advanced state, branches with scorched foliage or the consequent empty spæes created
by the fallen branches are conspicuous from far Closer inspection of an infected bush
would reveal that most of the branches that are in advanced stages of infection
snap away by succumbing to even the slightest external pressure This could come by
way of worker movements through the field while attending to numerous cultural
operations When the infection has reached this stage, the stem bases would be associated
with slightly raised, flat, spreading fruiting bodies of the fungus, which are blæk in
colour and are known as stromata (singular, stroma).

benchmark for  Hypoxylon stem bligh
Avoid planting of very susceptible cultivars in disease prone Additionally, similar
peotective measures can be adopted as suggested for susceptible cultivars under Thorny
stem blight.

CANKERS
Cankers are considered to be conditions created by Weak or wound parasites acting on a
stressed plant There are two canker situations in tea Most prominent is the Stem and
Branch Canker caused by Macrophoma, prevalent in the Low country tea districts
therefore also known as Low country canker The Collar and Branch Canker, caused by
phomopsis is confined to the Up country tea districts and is popularly known as Up 
country canker.

STEM AND BRANCH CANKER (Macrophoma theicola)
Macrophoma theicola Petch, which causes stem and branch canker in tea at low elevations
in Sri Lanka is considered to be a wound or weak parasite (Sabanayagam et al, 1974)
Infection takes place during prolonged dry weather, particularly in areas where the soil
is poor Normally, the disease would kill only the branches but complete kill of bushes
are not very uncommon under extremely unfavourable situations The incidence of the
disease has been on the increase in recent years, probably due to the progressively
deteriorating soil conditions associated with frequent droughts This has been further
egravated by the extensive planting of high yielding, susceptible cultivars such as TRI
2023 ald TRI 2026 under such deteriorating conditions.

placement for stem and branch canker
This disease is confined primarily to those districts of the Low country experiencing
extended dry spells Yet, there have been recent records of stem and branch cankers from
catain districts in the Mid country elevations in Uva and Kandy However, compared to
the smallholder sector, the relatively low incidence of this disease among large plantations
is attributed to the latter's reliance on fungicide schedules in the control of blister blight,
a benefit which can be considered secondary.

augury for stem and branch canker
The disease first appears as slightly sunken, dark patches on the red wood ofbranches of
about pencil thickness These patches are usually oval and run longitudinally along the
stem for a few centimetres The bark over these patches is killed by the fungus, which
turns black, becomes soft and gets separated from the wood The growth of the fungus is
usually arrested after it kills small areas of bark by the formation of callus around the
edges of the dead patches, which are commonly identified as cankers

In milder attacks, cankers can be completely callused-over within a few months,
particularly when supported by favourable weather In extreme cases cankers will continue
to spread onen with incomplete callus formation due to the fast growth rate of the fungus,
adequately supported by the continued unfavourable weather conditions This process
may continue until the entire branches are killed In cankers, which have
not healed over completely, fruiting bodies (pycnidia) may be found in the bark
tissues, which release spores that could start fresh infections In some eases the bark is
killed and blackened uniformly down to the base of the branch and the fungus enters the
main stem If it has reached the main stem it may encircle it completely, and if this
happens at the base of the main stem, the entire plant will be killed as in collar canker.

The fungus also attacks the older stems of mature tea bushes and causes typical cankers
on the upper surface of horimntal branches killing the bark and discolouring the wood
Wood rot sets in from the patches thus exposed very often these attacks take place in the
centre of the bush and go unnoticed until the time of pruning By this time the canker
would have reached an advanced stage with associated wood rotting.

rule for stem and branch canker
field observations and experimental data indicate variations in the susceptibility of
cultivars to this disease For example cultivars like TRI 2023 and 2026 were found to be
very susceptible while TRI 2025 and TRI 2027 were not

affected branches should be removed just below the canker and the cut ends treated with
an appropriate wound dressing, eg protective paint It must be aimed at removing as
much of the cankered branches as possible at the time of pruning The vacancies created
dead bushes should be supplied with plants of a less susceptible cultivar. In new
by the dead nushes should be supplied with plans of a less susceptible cultivar In new
elearings, the  following cultural practices should eventually reduce the incidence of the
disease
i) Avoid planting susceptible cultivars in areas with a history of the disease
ii) select only good vigorous plants with well-developed root systems for field
planting
ii) Avoid replanting in poor soils and in areas where rainfall is marginal or inadequate
iv) Thatch the soil during dry weather
v) Treat plants lightly during initial bringing into bearing period and also encourage
the development of good root systems
vi) provide adequate shade, particularly during early stages of growth.

COLLAR AND BRANCH CANKER (Phomopsis theae)
Collar and branch canker of tea, caused by Phomopsis theae Petch is yet another weak
parasitic situation confined to the Up country districts of Sri Lanka and assumes very
high significance during prolonged dry weather The disease is primarily confined to
young plantations and the damage causes death of plants in the age group of 2-8 years In
older plantations, the damage due to branch die-back is common, but very seldom is the
entire bush killed The disease has so tar not been found in nursery plants.

placement for COLLAR AND BRANCH CANKER
The disease is fairly widespread in the planting districts of Badulla, Haputale, Madulsima,
Udapussellawa, Nuwara Eliya and in the drier parts of Dimbula Thus the disease appears
to be confined to high elevations and to the NE monsoon sector in particular, preferring
cool dry conditions for its activity.

evidence for COLLAR AND BRANCH CANKER
The disease shows out plainly from a distance, the first obvious synptoms of attack
being brown foliage of the affected branch or of an entire bush, standing
out in contrast to the green foliage or the surrounding healthy bushes These symptoms
become more visible with the onset of rains that follow prolonged dry periods, consequent
to the fast comeback of the neighbouring unaffected bushes This gives a layman's notion
to the disease that it starts with the rains Closer examination would reveal a near complete
or complete girdling, located at the base of the affected branch or at the base of the
affected bush Cankers develop by gradual killing ofthC bark at or around the site of
infection, which takes place during dry weather In the early stages they are not so visible,
but older cankers can be recognised by their raised margins due to the development of
callus The diseased area may be regular or irregular in shape, onen sunken and grey to
black in colour on scraping with a knife, the underlying dead tissue can be seen In
cases where the collar is completely girdled, a thick ridge of callus forms at the upper
margin of the canker

In addition to causing cankers on older stems, the fungus can also infect apparently
uninjured, succulent green shoots, causing small local lesions. Sometimes the whole
shoot may be killed Some consider this to be beneficial on account of reduced foliage
and the consequent reduction in transpiration losses during dry weather Shoot infection
rarely causes serious damage to the bush, but the significance lies in their ability to
provide inoculum by way of spores for the infection of older stems.

Predisposing Factors and Mode of Spread
The disease is associated with dry weather and poor soil conditions and is particularly
bad in areas subjected to prolonged droughts One major predisposing factor is the poorly
developed root system Low soil moisture will have a direct bearing on low bark moisture
Infection can occur on stems of any size by means of spores, which are produced in
abundance on cankered bark and on infected green shoots The spores can either be
dispersed by wind or rain The fungus cannot penetrate undamaged bark Infection takes
place through leaf scars or wounds, which arc caused by normal agricultural operations
like pruning weeding and by agents like wind, sun and insects and also by falling stones
or rocks In grven shoots, most or the cankers appear to arise from leaf sears.

standard
Fortunately there is a marked variation in the susceptibility of different cultivars to the
disease and a number of them are found to be adequately resistant The fungus seldom
attacks tea bushes Older than eight years

As infection is sporadic and haphazard, prophylactic chemical treatment of all plants in
a new clearing is not recommended in order to prevent possible infection of a relatively
small number of plants The cultural measures proposed for the avoidance of Macrophoma
canker (see the previous section) can be successfully employed to reduce the incidence
of this disease.

ROOT DISEASES
Root diseases are a common feature when tea is grown on cleared jungle land. The presence
of infected tree stumps that are left behind serve as nuclei of infection. If a tree dies due
to a root disease in a jungle situation, which comprises of an array of tree/plant species,
its spread limited only to the extent bounded by the availability of trees of the same
susceptible species in the immediate neighbourhood The planting of tea as a monocrop
took away that delimitation, making room for steady spread of root diseases in vast
expanses

Root diseases spread slowly and they are predominantly active underground, invisible to
the eyes of even the most careful observer Thus the few known root diseases are able to
secure a firm hold on the tea bush, before their presence can be detected and control
mesures adopted. Disease transmission and the rate of spread are dependent on the
virulence of the given disease; some are fast and others relatively slow However, their
importance in reducing crop is great, not only because they cause death of the entire
bushes but also because of the long time lag, involved in making that land ready for the
subsequent crop of tea

The above ground symptoms of all root diseases are similar. They are always symptoms
of water shortage, because any plant afflicted with a root disorder is unable to support
the water demand of the canopy When such symptoms occur at a time when soil is not
deficient of water or when the whole bush or part of it suddenly dries up and dies with all
its leaves attached, they should indicate definite signs of a root disease The leaves often
turn a coppery brown and stay attached to the branches for a few days before they fall
off Such bushes should be dug up and their roots examined carefully for identification,
of the diseases and follow up treatment

When the disease is in an advanced state, fructifications of the causative fungus can
develop on the affected stumps of tea In older tea gardens, the chief source of infection
lies in the stumps of shade trees However, some infections can be initiated by wind-
borne spores The spores released from fungal fructifications settle and germinate either
on freshly cut tea branches or on shade tree stumps. The fungus ramifies through the
tissues and invades the entire root system But such instances of direct infection of tea by
wind-borne spores are very rare When the shade tree stumps are first infecte, the fungus
spreads from the roods of these shade tree stumps to neighbouring tea roots Root diseases
can also spread through secondary as a result of accidental dispersal of infected
material

Unlike other diseases. root diseases are difficult to control, because by the time their
presence is detected it is far too late Therefore, attention must be focussed on preventing
the spread of the disease to healthy tea once its presence has been detected

The first step is to remove all dead or dying bushes. along with all the roots, as soon as
they are detected and burn them on the spot, irrespective of the cause of death Under no
circumstances should the stump be left on the ground with only the branches removed
Any jungle or shade tree stump in the diseased patch must also be dug up and burnt, and
its lateral roots should bc traced and pulled out far as possible No roots, living or dead
and no woody material, which might become a food base, should be len in the soil

In order to stop the spread of root diseases, it is not sufficient only to remove the visible
affected bush, because, by the time it is diagnosed, adjacent bushes, though not showing
symptoms, may already be infected It is advisable therefore, to remove healthy looking
bushes surrounding the infected patches for examination to confirm that they are free of
infection

The felling of shade trees enhances the incidence ofeertain root diseases in tea Depleting
of roots of shade trees of their food reserves by ring-barking appears to lessen such
outbreaks significantly The object of ring-barking is to exhaust those shade trees Of their
root reserves, so that when they are felled, their roots will have little or no sustenanec for
the parasitic root fungi These depleted roots could nevertheless attract those fungi that
are saprophytic in a thriving condition, to the detriment of parasitic root fungi.

RED ROOT DISEASE (Poria hypolateritia)
Red root disease, commonly known as Porta, is caused by the fungus Poria hypolatentia
Berk The disease originated from the jungle where the fungus existed probably as a
weak partsite This has been a common occurrence in Sri Lanka since the first planting
of tea on plantation seale in lands that were originally in jungle and situated at elevations
over 600 m (2000 ft) When the jungle was cleared, the fungus survived as a saprophyte
on the roots and stumps of trees and then spread to the tea, on which it established itself
as a strong parasite

The disease can appear on solitary bushes or on several bushes in a patch It spreads by
means of mycelial strands or fungal threads that grow out from infected stumps or roots
and infect adjoining healthy tea roots Root contact is not essential for infection because
the fungus is able to grow through the soil by means ofwhat are known as rhimmorphs,
which are the aggregated mycelial strands The production of fruiting bodies is rare and
be seen only under undisturbed prolific spreading situations In view of this trend,
the disease is not considered to depend very heavily on airborne spores for its spread.

warning for red root disease
The above ground symptoms of all root diseases are alike and arc in keeping with the
general description earlier in this section affected bushes should, therefore, be dug
up with their roots and examined tor the presence of any fungal mycelium on the root
surface by carefully washing or scraping with a knife in order to identify the disease

In poria root discuse the mycelium should be scen on the surface of the root after it is
carefully wushed In fresh infections the mycelium is white, son and somewhat fluffy,
but it becomes compacted into smooth, thin flat dark red cords or sheets with time
These cords or sheets darken with age and become indistinguishable from the
root surface However, these cords remain white underneath, with the associated dark
red casings which arc smooth and rather brittle When the soil adhering to the root is
washed or shaken off along with the removal of a part of the red outer casing, the white
interior of the fungus strand is exposed This gives the older infected roots a red and
white speckled appearance In very advanced stages of infection, the roots become soft
and moist rendering them diflicult to be extracted from the soil The fungus eventually
completely disintegrates the root tissues, leaving a moist pulp

Occasionally fructifications are found at the collar They are in the form of
irregular thin flat plates which are pink-red in colour, taking the shape of the space it
occupies and perforated with minute holes.

Other Hosts
In addition to tea, the fungus attacks a variety Of other plants, Which can serve as sources
of infection tea plantations Albizzia moluccana, Erythnna lithosperma Grevillea
robusta and Tephrosia vogelii are some of the common alternative host plants found on
tea estates It also attacks jungle trees like symplocos spicata and Doona zeylamca.

reign for red root disease
Areas affected by Poria should undergo a thorough cleaning as the first step Remove all
the dead and dying bushes, including all those that show any slight yellowing of the
foliage, surrouding the visibly affected patch Examine the roots of the uprooted plants
for Pona mycelium to confirm infection

Any stumps of trees found within the infected patch must also be uprooted The patch
should be deep-forked and all roots, living or dead, oftea, jungle or shade trees- Of more
than pencil thickness should be carefully collected and burnt No woody roots that may
serve as a food base for the fungus should be leit in the soil All bushes and woody
material removed during the cleaning operation should be burnt on the spot

lf a number of bushes have died in several small patches close to each other, it would be
advisable to demarcate the entire area to include all patches into one contiguous large
patch and be treated as one unit while cleaning

At the time of cleaning the infected patch, all the bushes surrounding the cleared area
should be treated with a drenching spray of an appropriate systemic fungicide, at a given
dilution (as recommended by the TRI - see Advisory Circular No: DM2) to wet their
bases This treatment must be repeated at least three times at 2 to 3 monthly intervals
This is done to protect the apparently healthy peripheral bushes from eontracting the
disease

It is not advisable to plant an infected patch with tea direct however small that may be,
even after a thorough physical cleaning because of the possibility of leaving behind
some remnants of the fungal inoculum Ideally, all cleared up patches should be planted
with Guatemala or Mana grass for a period not less than of 18 to 24 months (upper limit
is for the fresh and active infections)

At the end of this rehabilitation period, the patch must be planted with a tea cultivar
which is more tolerant of the disease For further assurance of freedom from the disease,
these new plants too should be treated with a similar systemic fungicide, appropriately
diluted, starting at the time of planting and repeating at every 2-3 month intervals, for a
minimum of three rounds

The elaborate method of control using methyl bromide, which proved to be very successful
(though at a high cost), has been withdrawn because of the restrictions imposed on its
use worldwide, with the aim of completely phasing it out by the year 2015.

BLACK ROOT DISEASE (Rosellinia arcuata)
Black root disease is caused by the fungus Rosellinia arcuata Petch Normally, this spreads
at a faster rate compared to the other root diseases of tea As a result, any vigorous
looking tea bush can succumb within few days under favourable conditions It may spread
either radially or in a straight line

Rosellinia does its greatest damage during damp weather, when growing in a thick layer
of dead leaves on the surface of the soil It grows along the layer of dead leaves at a rapid
pace Upon reaching a tea bush, it encircles the stem and goes upwards for a short disease
But the main direction of growth is downwards towards the roots This kind of sprcading
habit may attack and kill a large number of bushes almost simultaneously Heavily thatched
new clearing with adequate shade may provide a very conducive environment for the
spread of this disease during wet weather Under such situations heavy damage could be
done in new elearings, leading to characteristic collar canker synptoms due to the death
of bark tissues ultimately resulting in the death of plants Very often these can be mistaken
for Phomopsis canker

on mature bushes, the funfus continues to grow downwards into the roots, killing and
rotting them Although Roselhnja can pass from bush to bush as Pona does, it rarely
causes the same extensive damage or proves so difficult to eradicate from an infected
site as Poria This is probably because it prefers a soil, which contains a large amount of
organic matter (dead leaves) and can spread through only in the uppermost layer of the
soil, which is most liable to desiccation in dry weather.

scattering for black root 
The disease is common in areas over 600 m (2,000 R) in elevation and occurs more
frequently in drier areas ofthe Up country Normally the infections do not originate from
old stumps Reports on the incidence of this disease are on the rise, particularly in the Up
country districts.

feature for black root 
On the surface of the infected roots, the mycelium forms black strands which are more or
less woolly in appearance and easily distinguishable from old cords of Porta The
mycelium of Rosellinia is at first white, then smoky grey and finally turns black When
the bark is carefUlly separated from the wood, small white star shaped patches of mycelium
can be usually seen on the wood surface The characteristic black mycelial strands on the
surface and the small white stars beneath the bark make Rosellinia easily recognisable
White to black strands of mycelium can sometimes be found on the bark of the collar
region, above the soil level

The tungus produces two kinds of spores, namely conidia and ascospores The conidia
are produced in large numbers on short bristle-like stalks, which are grouped together on
sheets of mycelium on the stem, at the collar region These present a black velvety
appearance The conidia are easily detached and can be blown away by the wind

The ascospores are produced in minute, spherical bodies called peritheeia (singular
pcrithecium), several of which occur in groups on the stem, among the remains of the
stalks, which bore the conidia They are black in colour and about 0 25 em in diameter
Each perithecium contains numerous cylindrical bodies called asci (singular aseus) in
which ascospores are produced Ascospores are usually produced on bushes that have
been for a long time.

Other Hosts
Rosellinia arcuata has been found to attack Erythrina lithosperma and Tephrosia vogelii.

head 
In the control ofRosellinia, two points must be borne in mind Firstly, the disease may be
transmitted to other spots by the spores, which are produced in abundance on almost
every dead bush Secondly, the upper layers of the soil around the dead bushes, and the
laver of dead leaves, are permeated by the mycelium which would have already reached
or infected the healthy bushes adjoining the diseased bushes The leaf litter should,
therefore, be raked away from the main stems of the bushes and burnt along with uprooted
diseased bushes, on the spot. It is not advisable to plant patches infected with Roselhma
immediately A suitable grass must be grown for 1 1/2 - 2 years before planting with tea

In new clearings, the disease can be prevented from spreading by reducing the shade and
ensuring that the thatch does not touch the base of the plant.

CHARCOAL R00T DISEASE (Ustulina deusta)
Charcoal root disease is caused by the fUngus Ustulina deusta (Fr,) Petrak Ustulina
usually attacks tea by spreading to its roots from the roots of decaying stumps Like in
the case of brown root disease, its prevalence is normally associated with the felling of
shade trees without prior ring-barking and leaving the stumps to decay on the site Very
often diseased or dead bushes are found in the vicinity of tall trees that have been killed
by lightning injury or adjacent to the decaying stumps In some instances, a row of dead
bushes can be traced along the course of a lateral root Unlike Poria, but similar to
brown root disease, the fungus cannot pass from one bush to another unless the roots are
in close contact The disease therefore occurs most frequently on solitary bushes or in
small patches.

passing round for charcol root 
The disease occurs in all tea growing districts of Sri Lanka, but it is generally more
serious in the Up country.

prodrome for charcol root
This disease is sometimes more difficult to identify than the other root diseases because
roots attacked by Ustuhna have no visible mycelium on the surface But if the bark is
removed, large white or brownish-white, fan shaped patches of mycelium are found
over-lying the wood The fans may frequently be illsed to form a thin
continuous sheet, but the fan structure is usually recognisable The wood is onen hard
and permeated by back sheets, which appear as black lines when they are cut through
such lines are found in wood killed by other fungi too, but in the case of Untulina the
lines are duplicated as if drawn with a faulty nib, which draws two parallel lines
simultaneously fructifications are produced in abundance on dead Grevillea and Albizzia 
stumps and frequently at the collar of diseased tea bushes They are somewhat ovoid in
shape and initially thin and plate-like, greyish-white in colour and dotted with black 
spots When old, they are charcoal black and brittle and hence the name "Charcoal Root"
for the disease.

Other Hosts
Besides tea, Ustulina attacks Grevillea robusta, Albi:zia moluccana, Erythrina
lithaspenna (Dadap), GliriCldia maculata, Hevea brasiliensis (Rubber) and other woody
plants.

jurisdiction for charcol root
When a bush dies of Ustulina, it should be dug up completely and burnt on the spot All
pieces of diseased roots must be collected and burnt Any dead jungle or shade tree
stumps found in the vicinity of the dead bush must also be dug up and burnt, and its
lateral roots should be traced and extracted as far as possible

The fundamental control of Ustulina consists of eliminating stumps oftrees with a potential
ofattracting the disease 'Ring-barking' prior to felling has a marked inhibitory effect on
the disease incidence and is therefore strongly recommended Also, cutting back the
stumps below ground level helps in reducing the possibility of infection. When mature
shade trees die due to lightning, take steps to remove them early to prevent potential
disease spots.

broute ROOT DISEASE (Phellinus noxius)
Causal organism was formerly known as Fomes noxius Corner Petch deseribed this to
be the earliest known root disease of tea The first record in Sri Lanka was in 1905 The
Brown root disease is a primary root disease, typically associated with the stumps of old
shale trees, but seldom causing any serious trouble Its prevalence is due to felling of
shade trees like Grevillea robusta and Albizzia moluccana without prior ring-barking
and leaving the stumps to decay on site The progress of the disease is usually slow and,
although the fungus produces external myeelium it docs not appear to spread to any
appreciable distance though the soil The spread of the disease from an infected to healthy
bush normally takes place through physical contact of roots

As in the casc of Ustuhna (sec the previous section) thc disease generally originates
from decaying stumps, especially those of Grevilleas It is also known to attack living
Grevilleas and to spread from their roots to tea Occasionally, the discasc has been recorded
as occurring in old tea where no stumps existed for many' years In such cases, the disease
has obviously spread by means of wind borne spores.

Dealing out for broute 
The could be found in all tea growing districts of Sri Lanka but with a higher prevalence
in the Uva region.

token for broute disease
Brown root disease is onc Of the easiest to recognise The most characteristic symptom
of the infected root is the adherence Of a crust of earth and gravel round the entire root
and extending up the collar, which cannot be easily knocked or washed Off
The mycelium or the fungus acts like a cement and binds the soil to the roots and the
or stems The mycelium can be seen tawny brown threads often collected into woolly
masses between the soil particles In older cases, these masses of mycelium Equire a
black, hard covering, sometimes with a brown powdery outer layer When the is
removed, there is usually a layer of white or brownish mycelium on the surface of the
wood The wood rarely shows much evidence of decay, especially if the bush has been
dug up as soon as it was dead, but in advanced eases it is permeated with yellow-brown
sheets, which assume a honeycomb structure and appear as a network of lines when the
wood is cut The fructifications are bracket-shaped, 7.5 to 10 cm broad and about 1.25 cm thick
very hard, but rarely found on diseased plants When mature and dry, it is purplish to
dark brown in colour and often with black concentric zones on the upper surface.

Other Hosts
In addition to tea, P noxius attacks Grevillea robusta, Ghricidia maculata, Erythnna
lithosperma, Tephrosia vogelii Hevea braslliensis and Theobroma cacao.

Command for token for broute
The control measures are the same as those described for Ustulina (see the previous
section).

Whtte ROOT DISEASE (Rigidiporus microporus)
The causative tungus of White root disease was originally known as Fomes lignosus
Klotzsch Then it was renamed as Rigldiporus hgnosus and changed a second time to its
present, Rrgdiporus micmporus This has been a primary and major root disease of
rubber over many years before it was found to attack tea and assuming a status of a
primary pest, especially on account of shifting cultivation patterns of tea and rubber or
the novel intercropping systems.

issue of whtee root 
This is basically a disease confined to Low country With the shifting of land use in the
Low country from rubber to tea, and their inter-planting that has been taking place in the
recent past, the disease is already assuming a great importance in tea.

Symptoms of whtee root
The diseased roots are covered with stout, rather flat eords of mycelium, which run more
or less longitudinally and unite with one another to form a network They are white or
yellowish in colour, when fresh they have a reddish tinge, which usually fades on drying

The fructifications are formed on the of the stem from which they are projected as
horizontal brackets Frequently several occur, one above the other forming tiers It is
semicircular in shape, 5 to 7 5 cm in diameter and 0 62 to 1  25 cm in thickness When
fresh, is reddish brown in colour.

Other Hosts
Besides rubber and tea, it attacks Erythrina lithosperma, Artocarpus integrifolia (jak),
Ficus spp and other trees.

dominance for whtee root
At the time of uprooting for replanting tea, it is very important to undertake a thorough
cleaning of any field, particularly those that have a history of white root disease All the
infected root fragments should be burnt in situ The field should be kept under a suitable
non-host rehabilitation grass (Mana or Guatamala) for a period of not less than 2 years
At replanting, treat all new plants with a drenching spray of a suitable fungicide as in the
ease of Poria root disease Alternatively, consider using a suitable antagonistic fungal
inoculum at the time of planting.

VIOLET ROOT DISEASE (Nectria mauritiicola)
This is considered a secondary root disease, as it is always associated with poor soil
aeration and water logging conditions The eausative fungus is Nectria mauritiicola B
and Br (formerly, Sphaemostilbe repens) and is a common soil dweller Unlike primary
root diseases, these secondary diseases can be avoided by adopting timely corrective
measures.

dispensation for violet root disease
The disease is not found in all soils, but may be common in specific locations that are
associated with clayey, ill-drained soils It is more prevalent at higher elevations though
the encounters are not ruled out in the country disease can attack teas of all
ages from about one year upwards but the characteristic symptoms arc produced when
the plants are two years and above.

hallmark for violet root
The surface of the roots, growing in poorly aerated soils may first become roughened
due to enlargement of lenticels, before being infected by Nectria mauntncola Roots
will appear either inky black or light violet in colour When freshly dug up, they have a
sour or vinegary smell.

when the bark of the affected root is peeled off, the wood underneath will reveal
characteristic veinations that are the creations of purplish black flattened mycelial strands
called rhizomorphs

They produce two kinds offructifieations The commoner one is the clusters of red stalked,
white headed conidia developing on the surface after a few days of exposure to
predisposing whether The second type is produced on the stem at or a little above the
collar and on exposed roots as clusters of minute red to black flask-shaped perithceia.

Other Hosts
This root disease has been recorded on Albizzia, Gliricidia, Erythrina and Tephrosia
candida.

sway for hallmark for violet root
All the infected and debilitated bushes should be uprooted and burnt As an immediate
measure, it is necessary to improve aeration of the soil in the anected area through proper
drainage Concurrently, all possible measures should be taken to improve the physical
u)nditrons ofthe soil by green manuring and by growing deep rooted shade tree species
The Infected area can be planted with tea, after an adequate rehabilitation period.

DIPLODIA DISEASE (Lasiodiplodia theobromae)
Though this is basically identified a root disease the causative fungus Lasiodiplodia
theohmmac Pat (formerly, Botryvdtplodja theobmmae). can attack any part of the tea
plant young or old, particularly when the plant is debilitated by other causes.

Distribution for DIPLODIA DISEASE
The organism has a very widespread occurrence But the incidence of the diseaseis
governed by other causes like poor soil conditions and low starch reserves, which can
render the tea plant weaker.

glimmer for hallmark for violet root
The first symptoms associated with the disease are exhibited from 6 Weeks to 3 months
after pruning The pruned bushes which may have appeared normal prior to pruning may
fail to produce any new shoots or if they do, they may grow to a height or 15-20 cm and
then begin to die back Their leaves become mottled with yellow and then turn black.

The roots of dead bushes do not bear any external mycelium of characteristic features In
advanced cases both bark and the wood Of affected roots appear bluish black due to the
mycelium that grows within the cells.

The minute black fructifications (pyenidia) of the fungus are embedded in the bark of the
root or or the collar They become visible with black circles and white centres When a
thin layer of the bark is shaved off.

Other Hosts
L theobromae be found on dead or dying roots and twigs of vinually all woody plants.

standerd for hallmark for violet root
Bushes killed by L theob,omae should be uprooted and bumt without delay If burung
of prunings is practised in an area, it is to add some lime before covering
the prunings with soil Most of all, it is necessary to improve the general health and the
vigour or the bush by judicious cultural operations and manurial treatments.


RED RUST (Cephaleuros parasiticus)
Red rust caused by an alga, Cephaleuros parasiticus Karst, unlike the majority of
Other diseases are caused by fungi As a problem, this is confined to the Low country
distriets of Sri Lanka, mostly on older tea

Usually the disease is more severe on weak and debilitated bushes Occasionally,
vigorously growing tea cultivars (vegetatively propagated) can also bc attacked The
main predisposing factors are adverse soil conditions such as poor fertility, alkalinity,
water logging as lack or aeration, formation of hard-pan and the droughts caused
by unfavourable weather Inadequate or complete absence of shade is also considered to
be another factor favouring the disease It has been observed that the branches weakened
by attacks of Macrophoma are easily infected by this alga.

flickers for MISCELLANEOUS
Infection takes place during the sporulation period, from April to July in each year Spores
are dispersed cither by wind or rain. Once the spore is deposited on a green shoot or leaf,
it starts to geminate, growing into the host tissue There, it multiplies at the expense of
the host cells and penetrates the deeper layers Of bark Whilst this is happening, the tea
plant responds by developing new tissues underneath the affected parts of the bark, in an
attempt to throw off infection The pressure of the developing alga underneath the infected
patches creates minute cracks on the surface of the bark When the infection matures, the
alga is stimulated to produce fruiting bodies on hair like peduncles, which emerge through
these minute cracks These hairs are red in colour and bear several knobs or sporangia at
their tips. Spores are produced in these sporangia in large numbers This maturation
process normally takes about one year from the time of infection

When the mature leaves are affected, the patches usually appear as olive green to red
circular spots on the leaf lamina But the damage caused to the plant by leaf infection is
negligible. When the infections occur on stems, they take the form of elongated brick red
to orange colour patches during the months of April to July
During the period the alga is fruiting, the leaves on affected stems develop a variegated
appearnce, being either green and white or green and yellow The stem of such shoots
with varegated leaves, are normally found to be associated with several patches of algal 
infection

Badly affected branches often die back, either partially or completely. New shoots
developing below the affected part may also get infected and if the discæse is not cheeked,
the process ofdie back continues. These repeated can gradually weaken the entire
bush with the consequent reduction in crop

Bushes that are severely attacked by Red rust can be easily recognised by their scanty
appearance Such bushes recover poorly after pruning, the new shoots being weak, spindly
and bearing very few leaves.

Other Hosts
Besides tea, Red rust also attacks the following plants which are grown as shade trees or
green manure crops on the estates: Albizzia chinensls, Albizzia sumatrana, Crotalana
anagvnndes, Crotalaria brownei, Gliricidia sepium and Tephrosia vogelii.

guide for MISCELLANEOUS
As Red rust is more common on weak plants, strengthening the host plant by improved
cultivation practices, fertiliser application, thatching young clearings during dry weather,
etc, should help to minimise the damage caused by the disease

In addition to the eultural methods given above, copper sprays have also been found to
be effective in keeping Red rust under control For effective control, three rounds Of
spraying at the rate of 450 g of fungicide (50 per cent copper) in 170 L of water per
hectare are required

For young tea, the first spray should be applied in April before sporulation of the alga,
and the second about four weeks later in May and the third somctime in June When
spraying fungicide, it is essential to cover both immature and mature stems of the upper
one third of the tea bush frame, on which the alga is sporulating

In older tea, the first spray application could be madc soon aner pruning, the second at
tipping and the third about four weeks later It is advisable to remove all the trailing
peripheral branches during pruning Full benefits of spraying will be evident only if
sprayins is continued for two or three successive years.

Ouspot Disease
Oilspot disease of tea is a very unusual form or disease, not widespread, occurring only
in seedling tea at high elevations (over 1800 m) This disease is not common and only a
few bushes are affected in each field (Mulder and Shanmuganathan, 1959)

It is suspected to be caused by a fungus, which has not yet been identified The fungus is
a weak parausite and it enters the frame of the bush through large pruning cuts that are
unprotected The woody tissues are attacked causing a soft rot A toxin produced after
the infection is translocated to the leaves to produce the characteristic 'oily spots' seen
on the leaves As the disease progresses, affected leaves fall off resulting in
death of the branches Continued infections could eventually kill a part or the entire
bush

No fructifications have so far been found on the affected bushes and the fungus has not
sporulated in laboratory cultures either

Attempts to stop the progress of the disease in affected bushes by removing the rotted
branches have been unsuccessful It is better to replace the diseased bush entirely as it is
not always possible to remove all the infacted wood.

PHLOEM NECROSIS VIRUS DISEASE (Camellia virus 1 Bond)
This disease brings about a gradual decline in general condition of the bush and in
sever cases the bush becomes stunted and unproductive Grafting experiments carried
out by Gadd (1939), and later confirmed by Bond (1944), established the causative

organism to be a virus As the disease affects the phloem tissues. leading to its necrosis,
the disease is called Phloem necrosis, meaning the death of the phloem However
numerous experiments undertaken to date were not able to establish the mode or
transmission of the disease

This disease has bæn reported only from Sri Lanka and has been observed only on
tea planted in the Up country above 1200 m (4000 n) or elevation This disease has been
recorded in every estate in the Nuwara iya district and from some estates in the Kotmale,
Dimbula Dickoya, Maskcliya, Agarapatana, Maturata Udapussellawa Haputale and
Bandarawela districts, all above 1200 m The small leaved cultivars Of tea (low jat) are
more sensitive to the disease, showing clear symptoms, while the larger leaved cultivars
(high jat) appear to bc tolerant or present themselves as synptomless carriers.

cue for Ouspot
The symptoms of the disease are more prominent in infected bushes that are recovering
from pruning Such bushes recover very slowly aner pruning and the green stems show
typical zigzag habit of growth, which may persist even when the stem becomes hard and
woody The stems appear wiry with short internodes The leaves are often curled
backwards accompanied by the inward folding of the leaf blades These
symptoms are often accompanied by the dwarfing of the leaves Sometimes they may be
exhibiting the upward twisting of the leaves, which are arranged in one plane along the
axis of the stem.

Although the typical forms ofcurling ofthe leaves, zigzagging of the stems and dwarfing
of the leaves are not likely to be confused with somewhat similar symptoms seen in
healthy plants, they do not themselves constitute diagnostic characters of the disease
Typical diagnostic character is therefore considered to be the necrosis of the phloem
tissue can be seen on examination Of the roots stems and leaf petioles If he bark
of the root is shaved away, necrotic zones of tissue, which are browntsh in colour can be
necrotic n-,ncs. which represent dead tissues may not be continuous. and
can be seen in irregular patches In the stem, the presence or necrosis can be scen as you
peel off a strip of back However, ncerosis in the stem is not as widespread as in the roots
The necrosis of the leaf can be seen with the naked eye in the eut or broken end of the
petiole If the outer surface or the petiole or midrib is scraped away, a continuous brown
region can be seen In severe cases this necrosis may be found in the rest of the main
verins of the leaves necrotic syniptoms may not be mandatory in every leaf of a
diseased bush, execpt in very severe disease situations The severity of the disease shows
an increase with the in elevation and this aspect is probably associated with low
temperature.

run for Ouspot
Viral diseases are difficult to control The only form of remedy is to replace badly affected
bushes with resistant cultivars Until recent times, vegetatively propagated tea cultivars
of wide jat were thought to be resistant to the disease, but recent observations have
Shown that some of them too can be susceptible Therefore, the existence of completely
resistant cultivars is doubtful, while symptom-less carriers are known Fortunately, so
far, the more popular cultivars have not shown any symptoms and therefore there has
been no associated decline in crop Most importantly, the disease is predominantly confined
to seedling teas in the very high elevational tea districts.

HORSE HAIR BLIGHT (Marasmius equicrinis)
This is not considered a parasitic disease situation though there is an identified organism
responsible The involved organism is a fungus known as Marasmius equicrinis Mull. It
is a saprophytic epiphyte favoured by high relative humidity and the temperatures
frequently experienced in the Low country The fungus obtains its nourishment from the
dead outer bark of older stems as well as from dead leaves and twigs that are trapped
within the tangle When the problem is at its height, there is physical interference in the
buslfi performance.

Disposition for horse hair bight
Horse hair blight has been reported from India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Australia In
Sri Lanka this is confined to the Low country tea districts that are below 600 m in elevation.

denotation for horse hair bight
The cords ofmycelium are black, round and shining, resembling hair These threads may
originate on the main stem near the ground or at any point on the branches, commonly on
that are in the centre These cords are aggregates of fungal hyphae and are known
as rhizomorphs The cords run upwards over the branches and on to the leaves, with
attachments at regular intervals by small cushions of agglutinated hyphae.

The fructifications have the same general form as mushrooms When they
are produced on aerial hyphae they may not be conspicuous, owing to their small size but
those produced by the hyphae fhllen on ground during wet weather are relatively large
and abundant and therefore cannot be missed-out easily The stalks of fructifications can
be about 1-2 cm long and assume the same colour as that of the hyphal cord The fruiting
body is red-brown to yellow-brown in colour The spread of the fungus is through spores
which can be either windborne or waterborne

The mycelial network that develops within the frame of the tea bush gradually starts
trapping the falling leaves Wallowed to continue undisturbed, these collections accumulate
steadily giving an unsightly appearance to the bush The debris thus collected provides
more nourishment to the epiphytic fungus, resulting in a dense mycelial mesh only to
entangle more falling leaves and debris At its extreme intensity, potential to create added
physiological stress on the plant by way of added demand on water through the plant
system is not totally ruled out.

rule for horse hair bight
Under the majority of Low country situations, the problem starts building up very early
Therefore, it is very important that the problem is addressed, starting from the first pruning
cycle Spraying of the tea bush frame with hydrated lime (10 per cent solution) has been
proved to be very effective in controlling the growth of the fungus If the growth of the
epiphytic fungus is already heavy, attempts should first be made to physically remove it
as far possible to be followed by hydrated lime application If the pruned branches
carry heavy festoons of mycelial remnants, they must be burnt along the field edges.
